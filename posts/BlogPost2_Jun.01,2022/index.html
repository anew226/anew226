      <p>Keyboard shortcuts save me time! I'm crazy about keyboard shortcuts because I don't believe in spending any more time doing paperwork than I have to.</p>

      <p>All of us are spending a lot more time working with computers than we used to. Even as a mechanical technician (which is a very hands-on job), I spend a large portion of my day typing and editing text on my computer. It's difficult to arrive at an exact number, but I'm sure we'd all be very surprised to find out exactly how much time we all spend typing.</p>

      <p>Follow these 7 tips to give your typing a boost to help you defeat your busy day and <strong>Chuck Norris</strong>, and save the world!</p>

      <p>Before we get to all that, we first need to learn the techniques.</p>

      <h2>Lesson 1: Snapping Windows</h2>

      <p>No more wasted time resizing windows with your mouse. No, I didn't save the best for last. I believe in leading with a winner. Personally, this is my favourite.</p>

      <p>Being able to quickly snap windows to the left or to the right enables me to put things exactly where I want.</p>

      <p>Instead of using my mouse to find the edge of a window and then stretching it, then moving it, then stretching it again, then shrinking it, then moving it again, <strong>SNAP</strong> that window into place using only 2 keys.</p>

      <p>Try it for yourself:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong><em>&#8862;</em> + &#8592;</strong> will snap focused window to the left side of the screen</li>
        <li><strong><em>&#8862;</em> + &#8594;</strong> will snap focused window to the right side of the screen</li>
        <li><strong><em>&#8862;</em> + &#8593;</strong> will maximize focused window</li>
        <li><strong><em>&#8862;</em> + &#8595;</strong> will minimize focused window</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Note: </strong>you will most likely find the Windows Key <strong><em>&#8862;</em></strong> at bottom left of your keyboard between<strong><em> </em>Ctrl </strong>and<strong><em> </em>Alt.</strong></p>

      <p>Don't sweat, it won't take long before you're an expert window snapper.</p>

      <h2>Lesson 2: Copy, Cut, &amp; Paste</h2>

      <p>I know most people probably already know about these shortcuts. However, I use these absolutely everywhere. These are my bread and butter when it comes to editing text.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ctrl + X</strong> to <strong>cut</strong> highlighted text and place into memory</li>
        <li><strong>Ctrl + C</strong> to <strong>copy</strong> highlighted text and place into memory</li>
        <li><strong>Ctrl + V</strong> to <strong>paste</strong> text from memory</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Let's have some fun editing. Here's some dummy text we'll use for the rest of the lessons:</p>

      <hr />
      <blockquote>
        <p>Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Chuck Norris has 72... and they're all poisonous.<br />
        Chuck Norris once bowled a 300... without a ball... he was not even in a bowling ally.<br />
        Chuck Norris defeated a 12-year-old boy in a game of Connect Four in only three moves.<br />
        NASA hired Chuck Norris to conduct Mars exploration. He will bring Mars to NASA by the time you finish this sentence.<br />
        Chuck Norris is currently suing NBC, claiming Law and Order are trademarked names for <em><u>his left and right legs</u></em>.<br />
        Crop circles are Chuck Norris' way of telling the world that sometimes corn needs to lie down.<br />
        Chuck Norris does not get frostbite. Chuck Norris bites frost.<br />
        Chuck Norris doesn't read books, he stares them down until he gets the information he wants.<br />
        Chuck Norris does not sleep, he waits.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr />
      <p>Follow these instructions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Press <strong><em>&#8862;</em> + &#8592;</strong> to snap this blog post to the left half of your screen.</li>
        <li>Highlight all the <strong>Chuck Norris</strong> text and then press <strong>Ctrl + C</strong></li>
        <li>Open <strong>Word</strong></li>
        <li>Use <strong><em>&#8862;</em> + &#8594</strong> to snap <strong>Word</strong> to the right half of your screen</li>
        <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + V</strong> to paste the text into a blank document</li>
        <li>Highlight this text: '<u><em>his left and right legs</em></u>.'</li>
        <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + X</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>You just took out Chuck's legs! You're ready to move on to the next level.</p>

      <h2>Level 3: Bold, Italic, and Underline</h2>

      <p>Sometimes you might want to emphasize some text. That's where these 3 friends come in handy.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ctrl + B</strong> bolds highlighted text</li>
        <li><strong>Ctrl + I</strong> italicizes highlighted text</li>
        <li><strong>Ctrl + U</strong> underlines highlighted text</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now that we've taken out Chuck's legs, it's time to find the way forward to defeat him.</p>

      <p>Follow these instructions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>With your mouse, one at a time, double-click these words to highlight
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chuck</strong> (only first instance)</li>
            <li><strong>Norris</strong> (only first instance)</li>
            <li><strong>was</strong></li>
            <li><strong>defeated</strong></li>
            <li><strong>by</strong></li>
            <li><strong>you</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use <strong>Ctrl + B, Ctrl + I,</strong> and <strong>Ctrl + U</strong> to emphasize each word</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You are now a <strong>Bold, Italic, Underline</strong> master. You are ready for the next level.</p>

      <h2>Level 4: Home &amp; End</h2>

      <p>Now it's time to bring the cursor <strong>Home</strong> and <strong>End</strong> this.</p>

      <p>(On most standard keyboards you can usually find both <strong>Home</strong> and <strong>End </strong>above the arrow keys &mdash; just to the right of <strong>Insert</strong> and <strong>Delete</strong>.)</p>

      <p>These two keys put your cursor, either to the <strong><em>beginning</em></strong> of a line of text, or to the <strong><em>end</em></strong> of a line of text. Using them by themselves is great. Also using them with <strong>Shift</strong>&nbsp;is wonderful.</p>

      <p>Follow these instructions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Find a line that does not have any <strong>Bolded, Italicized,</strong> or <strong>Underlined</strong> words</li>
        <li>Place your cursor anywhere on the line</li>
        <li>Press <strong>Home</strong> (your cursor should be at the <em><strong>beginning </strong></em>of the line)</li>
        <li>Press &amp; hold <strong>Shift</strong> and then press <strong>End</strong> (the entire line should be highlighted)</li>
        <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + X</strong> to cut</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The text is gone! You are ready for the next level.</p>

      <h2>Level 5: Undo &amp; Redo</h2>

      <p>Sometimes I accidentally do something I didn't mean to do. We all know that there is an <strong>Undo</strong> button at the top of many applications. However, there is an even faster way to <strong>Undo</strong> those mistakes. This trick is so fast I sometimes get carried away and <strong>Undo</strong> too much. Don't worry though, if you get carried away with&nbsp;<strong>Undo</strong>ing, there is a <strong>Redo</strong> too.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ctrl + Z</strong> Undo</li>
        <li><strong>Ctrl + Y</strong> Redo</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There is no try. There is only <strong>Undo</strong> and <strong>Redo</strong>. You are ready for the next level.</p>

      <h2>Level 6: Ctrl + Arrows</h2>

      <p>I recently discovered this trick, and I love it.</p>

      <p>Try it out with me:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + &#8592;</strong> to jump to the beginning of the <strong><em>previous</em></strong> word</li>
        <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + &#8594;</strong> to jump to the beginning of the <strong><em>next</em></strong> word</li>
        <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + &#8593;</strong> to put your cursor at the beginning of the current paragraph</li>
        <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + &#8595;</strong> to put your cursor at the <strong><em>end</em></strong> of the current paragraph</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And, if you're brave, try this:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + Shift</strong> and then use the arrows to highlight text</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Now, use all these techniques to remove all but these 6 words:</p>

      <hr />
      <p><strong>Chuck</strong><br />
      <strong>Norris</strong><br />
      <strong>was</strong><br />
      <strong>defeated</strong><br />
      <strong>by</strong><br />
      <strong>you</strong></p>

      <hr />
      <p>Congratulations! You have done the impossible. You defeated <strong>Chuck Norris</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Level 7: Save</h2>

      <p>It's always a good idea to save your work frequently. These days it's less of an issue. However, it's still a good to know that all your hard work will not be lost if your program crashes, or your battery suddenly dies.</p>

      <p>Now it's time to <strong>Save</strong> the world:</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + S</strong></li>
            <li>Name the file '<strong>the world'</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>You have literally (very literally) <strong>Saved</strong> 'the world. Not bad for a day's work!</p>
