      <h1>Set Up Quantum + Find Your Q-Pulse</h1>
      <p>Tips for New Techs</p>

    <article>
      <p>Finding and training new Technicians is one of the greatest challenges any maintenance shop faces. This is especially true now that we've collectively experienced the great resignation in our industry.</p>
      <p>It can be difficult to find experienced technicians. Furthermore, training technicians is a lengthy, ongoing process. There's never a shortage of new things to learn.</p>
      <p>Luckily, AJWT is a great place to learn. We're lucky to have so many senior technicians willing to train <strong>The Next Generation</strong> of technicians.</p>
      
      <p>Although soon the way we interact with Quantum will most likely change (thanks to the Quantum Web App being developed), I thought it would be a good idea to share some of the Quantum tricks I've picked up since I started at AJWT.</p>
      <p>I've compiled a short list of <strong>tricks</strong> and <strong>tips</strong> that my colleagues have passed on to me. Now, I pass those tricks to you.</p>
      <hr>
      
      <h2>Patrick's Hat Trick</h2>
      <p>@Patrick Fregeau taught me these invaluable rules when I first started at AJWT.</p>
      <p>These are the three things you, as a technician, need to verify <em>before</em> starting work on a component:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Verify that the <strong>Part Number</strong> and the <strong>Serial Number</strong> on the Unit match the <strong>Part Number</strong> and the <strong>Serial Number</strong> on the paperwork?</li>
        <li>Verify that we have the <em>correct</em> <strong>CMM</strong>?</li>
        <li>Verify that we have the <em>correct</em> <strong>tools</strong>?</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>OK, Let's break this down.</p>
      
      <h3>Verifying Part Number and Serial Number</h3>
      <p>Let's start by opening Quantum. Here's a screenshot of the desktop shortcut. It looks like a gear &mdash; for all the gearheads.</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/Quantum_open_1.jpg" alt="screenshot of Quantum Control Desktop Shortcut">
      </figure>
      
      <p>To get any work done, you need to select the '<strong>Live Database</strong>'.</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/Quantum_open_2.jpg" alt="screenshot of Selecting Live Database">
      </figure>
      
      <p>Once Quantum has finished loading, open '<strong>Shop Control</strong>'. You have an option: Either press the '<strong>Shop Control</strong>' icon at the top of the screen (indicated in pic below) or press <strong>Ctrl + 9</strong>:</p> <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/Quantum_open_3.jpg" alt="screenshot indicating icon for opening Shop Control" style="width: 102px">
      </figure>
      
      <p>Press '<strong>F</strong>' and then type the Work Order number into the top field: (Note: the last WO you worked on will populate Shop Control by default).</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/Quantum_open_5.jpg" alt="screenshot of 'Find for Browsing Work Orders'">
      </figure>
      
      <p>Press '<strong>Enter</strong>'. You should now see your Work Order with some tasks.</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/Quantum_open_7.jpg" alt="screenshot of WO open in Quantum">
      </figure>
      
      <p>Next, read the <strong>Part Number</strong> directly from the Unit's ID plate. Now verify it against these documents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Repair Order</strong></li>
        <figure>
          <img loading="lazy" src="pics/CheckingPNandSNonRO.jpg" alt="pic of RO highlighting Part Number and Serial Number">
        </figure>
      
        <li><strong>The Removal Tag</strong> - Note: the removal tag will also have information regarding the serviceable unit that replaced the unserviceable currently in front of you (you can ignore the info on that serviceable unit). Also, make a note of the reason for removal. In this case INOP. is short for inoperable.</li>
        <figure>
          <img loading="lazy" src="pics/CheckingPNandSNonRemovalTag.jpg" alt="pic of Removal Tag highlighting Part Number and Serial Number">
        </figure>
      
        <li><strong>WO in Quantum</strong></li>
        <figure>
          <img loading="lazy" src="pics/Quantum_CheckPNandSN.jpg" alt="screenshot of Quantum highlighting Part Number and Serial Number">
        </figure>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: if your unit is missing its ID plate, as long as the <strong>Part Number</strong> and <strong>Serial Number</strong> on the Removal Tag match the <strong>Repair Order</strong> and <strong>Quantum</strong>, you have enough information. If you have no ID plate and no Removal Tag, it will be up to your cell lead to ask a Customer Service Manager to contact the unit's customer.</p>
      
      <h3>Verify Correct CMM and Tools</h3>
      <p>Currently, at AJWT, we keep all our documents in <strong>Q-Pulse</strong>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/QPulse_1.jpg" alt="pic of Q-Pulse Desktop Icon" style="width: 102px">
      </figure>
      
      <p>First, open Q-Pulse, then expand the '<strong>Documents</strong>' section and search by Part Number (or, if you know the ATA, you can search by the ATA number)</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/QPulse_2_searchingDocs.jpg" alt="screenshot of searching for Documents in Q-Pulse">
      </figure>
      
      <p>A new window will pop up, and you should see a list of all the documents pertaining to that unit.</p>
      <p>To start work, you need have these two documents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>TCMM</strong> - the <strong>Component Maintenance Manual</strong></li>
        <li><strong>TTE</strong> - the <strong>Tool Equivalency</strong> (Tool List)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you at least have those two documents, you can <strong>start work</strong> on your unit.</p>
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: sometimes you'll also have a <strong>TCRM - Component Repair Manual</strong>.</p>
      
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/QPulse_3_searchingDocs.jpg" alt="screenshot of document list for Part Number 31077">
      </figure>
      
      <p>More than likely you'll have other documents associated with your unit. These are the most common:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>TEI</strong> - <strong>Engineering Instructions</strong> which contain special instructions from engineering (which might include alternates, special repair instructions, etc)</li>
        <li><strong>TJCL</strong> - Engineering <strong>Justification Checklist</strong> is the engineer's justification for creating the TEI</li>
        <li><strong>TAD</strong> - <strong>Airworthiness Directive</strong> documents a known safety deficiency with a particular model of aircraft that <strong>must</strong> be corrected (you must comply with the instructions in these documents)</li>
        <li><strong>TSB</strong> - <strong>Service Bulletin</strong> documents improvements that operators can choose to comply with the improve the functionality of a unit (these are optional - up to customer's discretion)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may also see:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>TCSI</strong> - <strong>Customer Special Instructions (check)</strong> are documents related to a specific customer's additional instructions related to the maintenance of the unit. For example: <strong>Delta Pubs</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      
      <h2>Peter's Powerful Quantum Layout</h2>
      <p>@Peter Demeter is my cell lead. Peter has taught me most of what I know about Quantum.</p>
      <p>When I first started, he showed me how to set up Quantum. I've customized my layout since then. However, it's still very close to the layout Peter showed me three years ago.</p>
      
      <h3>Shop Control Parts Management (Ctrl + 9)</h3>
      <p>In Quantum, you should still have '<strong>Shop Control</strong>' open from the last step. Navigate to the '<strong>Parts Management</strong>' Tab.</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/Quantum_PartsMan_Navigate.jpg" alt="screenshot indicating how to navigate to Parts Management Screen in Shop Control">
      </figure>
      
      <p>You'll have a bunch of columns with Part Numbers, Part Description, etc....</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/Quantum_PartsMan_1.jpg" alt="screenshot of Parts Management Screen">
      </figure>
      
      <p>You can customize these columns so the information you want to see is exactly where you want to see it.</p>
      <p>I have mine set up like this (from left to right):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Part Number</li>
        <li>Part Description</li>
        <li>Cond Lev (check)</li>
        <li>Figure</li>
        <li>Sub-WO Number</li>
        <li>Remarks</li>
        <li>Disposition</li>
        <li>Unit Price</li>
        <li>Cond</li>
        <li>Qnty Needed</li>
        <li>Qnty Res (check)</li>
        <li>Qnty Issued</li>
        <li>Part Qnty OH</li>
        <li>Part Qnty Ava (check)</li>
        <li>Alt On Hand</li>
        <li>Alt Available</li>
        <li>Task</li>
        <li>Activity</li>
        <li>PO</li>
        <li>Next Delivery Date</li>
        <li>RO Number</li>
        <li>Qnty Turned In</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Personally, I don't have any reason to bother with the rest of the columns.</p>
      
      <p>To customize, all you do is click and drag the columns where you want. You can also resize. Once you're happy with the way things look, just right click the table and select '<strong>Save to personal settings</strong>'. (If you don't have time for that, just press <strong>Ctrl + Alt + S</strong>.)</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/Quantum_PartsMan_2_saveToPersSett.jpg" alt="screenshot indicating how to 'Save to peronsal settings'">
      </figure>
      <p><strong>Customize this screen as necessary to serve your specific needs, then 'Save to personal preferences.'</strong></p>
      
      <h3>Inventory Control (Ctrl + 1)</h3>
      <p>When I'm not working in '<strong>Shop Control</strong>', I'm usually in the '<strong>Inventory Control</strong>' module doing a little research on specific Part Numbers.</p>
      <p>There's also a lot of information on this screen. Luckily, we can also customize the layout.</p>
      <p>As a technician, I'm interested in nine screens to when I'm looking up a Part Number:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Work Order BOM History</li>
        <li>Repair Order History</li>
        <li>Stock Transaction Detail</li>
        <li>Purchase Order History</li>
        <li>Alternate/Cross Reference Detail</li>
        <li>Current Stock Reservations</li>
        <li>Stock Summary</li>
        <li>Work Order Main Component History</li>
        <li>Stock Line History Detail</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>To customize this screen, right-click at the top of one of the '<strong>browses</strong>' (any '<strong>browses</strong>' heading will do) and click 'Configure Browses'.</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/Quantum_RightClick_ConfigBrowses.jpg" alt="screenshot of where to click on 'browses' headings">
      </figure>
      
      <p>Select 3 rows and 3 columns</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/Quantum_InventoryControl_3.jpg" alt="pic showing how to set up Inventory Control 'Browses'">
      </figure>
      
      <p>Drag and drop to put your '<strong>browses</strong>' where you want</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/Quantum_InventoryControl_4.jpg" alt="screenshot indicating how to drag and drop 'browses' to customize Inventory Control Screen">
      </figure>
      
      <p>When you're happy with how your '<strong>Inventory Control</strong>', click '<strong>OK</strong>'.</p>
      
      <p>There you go. Now you can research Part Numbers in Quantum like a boss!</p>
      
      <h3>Customizing Buttons in your Quantum Nav</h3>
      <p>Most techs will only use a few modules. There's no sense in having a bunch of buttons visible that you'll never use. To customize your navigation, <strong>click</strong> the small button to the right of all the large buttons (where indicated), and then <strong>click</strong> '<strong>Add or Remove Buttons</strong>'.</p>
      <p>Personally, I only use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inventory Control</li>
        <li>Repair Orders</li>
        <li>Shop Control</li>
        <li>Time & Attendance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, you can customize to suite your needs.</p>

      <h2>Jo's Costing / Finalizing Checklist</h2>
      <p>@Jizhou Yu gave me this checklist when he was training me years ago, and I've been using it ever since.</p>
      <p>I add to this checklist whenever I come across something new, or when I need to remind myself of something that I easily forget. There's only so much space in my head!</p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <h4>== Before Sending Unit to 'Costing', please verify == </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Labour hours added to tasks you worked on</li>
          <li>Tasks have notes on them to say what you've done - also add name, EMPLOYEE #, and date
            <ul>
              <li><em>'UNIT ASSEMBLED: READY FOR TEST. Chandler Bing 0123, Jun.29, 2022'</em></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Check for <strong>AD</strong>s and <strong>SB</strong>s to see if any apply to unit</li>
          <li>Upload pictures to Quantum: Damage pics / Missing Parts pics</li>
          <li>Ensure 'missing' IPC is scanned (if you have missing parts, include scan of CMM indicating that missing parts are required as per CMM)</li>
          <li>Edit Header (<strong>G E</strong>) =&#62; quoted for: <strong>insp/test, repair, OH</strong> - if warranted indicated, update: <strong>We Resp</strong> or <strong>Cust Resp</strong>, etc....</li>
          <li>Ensure 'PN out' is correct (e.g.: carrying out an <strong>SB</strong> may change <strong>PN</strong>) =&#62; edit in Header (<strong>G E</strong>)</li>
          <li>Close tasks (only if you're qualified and have SCA)</li>
          <li>Ensure Tear Down / Inspection Report is written =&#62; ensure CMM is referenced in Faults Section (under Repair) (***DO NOT reference TEIs on Tear Down)</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>== Before Closing WO & Signing Maintenance Release, please verify ==</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Final Assembly is complete</li>
          <li>2 AJWT stickers attached to unit</li>
          <li>Lockwire is complete</li>
          <li>AJWT 'heatshrinks' applied to lockwire (as necessary)</li>
          <li>'Final Pics' are uploaded to Quantum (finalizing unit)</li>
          <li>Test Papers are uploaded to Quantum</li>
          <li>Labour hours are added to tasks</li>
          <li>Edit Header (<strong>G E</strong>) =&#62; quoted for: <strong>insp/test, repair, OH</strong> - if warranted indicated, update: <strong>We Resp</strong> or <strong>Cust Resp</strong>, etc....</li>
          <li>Edit Header (<strong>G E</strong>) =&#62; under 'Miscellaneous' (for 'Block 12' on Form One)- ensure current revision of CMM is referenced
            <ul>
              <li><em>'This unit was repaired in accordance with CMM __-__-__, Rev. xx, Dated: xxx xx/xx.'</em></li>
              <li><em>'For more information, please refer to the Tear Down / Inspection Report'</em></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Check for Times and Cycles of unit (<strong>G E</strong>) - for Time Life units, include times (TSN, CSN | TSR, CSR | TSO, CSO) in 'Block 12' of Form One</li>
          <li>Check Q-Pulse for TCSI (Customer Special Instructions)</li>
          <li>Ensure Tear Down / Inspection Report is finished (***DO NOT reference TEIs on Tear Down)</li>
          <li>Issue all parts (<strong>M I A S</strong>)</li>
          <li>Airbus Flight Controls: place desiccant with unit in shipping bag - just before bringing unit to shipping</li>
          <li>Check for BLUE shipping-box tag (if you have a BLUE shipping-box tag, attach to Form One / Tear Down Package)</li>
          <li>Ensure GREEN Serviceable tag is attached to unit before bringing unit to shipping</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I like to put this list on a <strong>Sticky Note</strong> so I can easily pull it up anytime I need to refer to it.</p>
      <p>In the <strong>Search Bar</strong> at the bottom of your screen, type: "<strong>Sticky Notes</strong>".</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/StickyNotes_1.jpg" alt="screenshot showing how to find 'Sticky Notes' app on Windows 10">
      </figure>
      <p>Open the <strong>Sticky Notes</strong> App.</p>
      <p>Next, open this:</p>
