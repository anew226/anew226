      <p>Well, actually, documentation is everyone's best friend.</p>

      <h3>Friday Night is Music Night</h3>
      <p>When I was living in Northern BC, my wife and I had a group of friends that we'd play music with on Friday nights. We were living in a small, rough town where everyone and their grandma drove an oversized pickup truck. It wasn't uncommon to see a pickup with a gun rack and some hooves hanging off the tail gate. (The sight of lifeless hooves was a horrifying for a couple of skinny vegans.) It was a small town where you were constantly running into people you know. Fortunately, for our music night, we knew the owner of a small cafe downtown where we could play music until 2:00 in the morning.</p>
      <p>One night while playing music, our friend Elaine invited us to have music at her house. So, I wrote her address on a small piece of paper and filed it into my wallet for safe keeping.</p>
      <p>Before I know it, music night at Elaine's came. So, we made our way to the address I wrote down on that little piece of paper. When we arrived at her street, it was already dark. The addresses were difficult to read from inside the car, so I parked my car and grabbed my guitar from the back. I made my way to the house will all the cars parked in front of it. The doorbell was broken, so I checked the door. It was open. "Ah, Elaine has left the door open because she knows we're coming. That's nice!"</p>
      <p>To be polite I took my shoes off at the door and then climbed the carpeted stairs to the living room. Some of Elaine's other friends were already there, and they were already eating some food. I put my guitar down and was about to sit down on the couch. However, I thought I'd be polite. So, I introduced myself, "You must be Elaine's friends. Hi, I'm Andrew."</p>
      <p>Her friends seemed a little shy and awkward. There was an awkward silence, then they looked at each other and then back at me. The guy turned to me and said, "Who's Elaine?"</p>
      <p>Now I was feeling awkward. "Isn't this 15886?"</p>
      <p>"No, this is 15888. Um, I think you're in the wrong house buddy."</p>
      <p>My face turned a little red. "Oh, I'm in the wrong house! Excuse me. I'm sorry."</p>
      <p>On my way out, I looked closer at the address. Sure enough, it was 15888. How embarrassing. I won't make that mistake again.</p>
      <p>Not long after, I got a good job on the other side of Canada. So, my wife and I moved to Toronto. After getting settled in for a couple years, we planned a road trip back to BC in July. Music night was at the top of the agenda. However, since we had moved away, the downtown cafe was closed. Fortunately, Elaine invited us back to her place again. July came, so we flew to Vancouver, and then drove into the interior. It was music night again, and it was dark. I wasn't going to make the same embarrassing mistake I made last time. I had made a strong mental note about Elaine's house. This time I recognized Elaine's house right away. So, I grabbed my guitar and made my way upstairs. To my shock, it was a bad case of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu! I was in the wrong house again! I had remembered the wrong house &mdash; it had been familiar for the wrong reasons! I was back in 15888, and the owners were having dinner again. It was a bad time warp.</p>
      <p>Apparently, my system for finding friend's houses in the dark needed a little help.</p>

      <h2>Repeating Suboptimal Processes</h2>
      <p>During both those incidents where I disturbed Elaine's neighbours while they were eating dinner, I actually had a smartphone in my pocket with GPS, contacts, and a flashlight. Unfortunately, I was still operating from outdated methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I wrote Elaine's address down on a loose piece of paper </li>
        <li>I assumed that many cars in front of a house meant music night was happening there</li>
        <li>I didn't use a flashlight to read the house numbers</li>
        <li>I assumed that Elaine had left her front door open for me</li>
        <li>After two years I was relying on memory: I remembered the wrong house was familiar, but I didn't remember why it was familiar until I was disturbing Elaine's neighbours again</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, it didn't matter if I had a digital tool in my back pocket that could have made address hunting easier &mdash; I was stuck in my old ways.</p>

      <h2>Documentation to the Rescue</h2>
      <p>Last month, at the <a href="https://www.aircraft-commerce.com/product/airline-aerospace-mro-flight-ops-it-conference-2022-emea/?dm_i=13QF,7TKI7,9A3502,VWYEU,1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Aircraft Maintenance IT Conference</strong></a> in London, I attended a talk by Allan Bachan that really resonated with me. Allan is VP of MRO Operations Consulting at <a href="https://www.icf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ICF</strong></a>.</p>
      <p>According to Allan, the way to get the most out of your tools is to study your businesses processes. The idea is actually very simple. The implementation, according to other organizations at the conference that had already carried out their own studies of their own business' processes, is time consuming. However, they all agreed, studying their business' processes was invaluable and worth all the effort.</p>
      <p>During Allan's talk, his associate from <a href="https://interfacing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>interfacing</strong></a> demonstrated some software that enables organizations to map their processes, empowering businesses to identify:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>how well business processes are currently enabled by technology</li>
        <li>the gaps and opportunities</li>
        <li>a strategy for improvement</li>
        <li>how to embed a culture of continuous improvement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Allan also emphasized that you do not have to use his associate's software, and you don't even need to hire him to do this process mapping for you. Allan's main takeaway: by document your business' processes, you will empower yourself by identifying your specific opportunities, and areas of improvement.</p>

      <h2>80/20 Rule in Action</h2>
      <p>It's possible to realize 80% of the benefits by focusing your efforts on the highest value 20%. You don't need to improve everything right now. You just need to focus your efforts on the 20% that will improve your life by 80%.</p>
      <p>Let's apply the 80/20 rule to my house finding process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Put Elaine's address and phone number into my phone's contacts</li>
        <li>Use my phone's flashlight to read the house numbers BEFORE trying the front door</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hurray for technology! Hurray for smartphones! And, it didn't take much effort to dramatically improve my house finding process.</p>
      <p>With regards to the most important areas of improvement for yourself, only you can determine what those areas are.</p>
      <p>By studying your business, you will be well informed to know which tools are worth investing in, and which tools are not worth investing in. Ultimately, documentation will empower you to take full advantage of the tools that you already have and the tools that you will buy.</p>
