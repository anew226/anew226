      <p>Have you seen these new fancy 'flying cars'? Personally, I can't wait to climb into one of these. This would save me from my commute &mdash; my middle finger is really tired from driving in Montr&eacute;al traffic. Actually, I don't drive that way. I used to. But something happened that changed my mind about driving, forever.</p>
      <p>When I first started working, I bought myself a new car. For a moment, I was on top of the world; I had a great job, a new car, and a very sexy girlfriend. However, one day when I was driving to pick up my girlfriend for a date, I had a little accident with my new car.</p> 
      <p>You see, there was this awkward intersection with a lot of traffic. I was just fresh out of driver's training, and I was driving a new car. So, I didn't want a single scratch. I was being careful. However, there was this impatient guy behind me who had other plans. He started honking at me to "Get on with it!" I thought he was a jerk, so I showed him my middle finger. Obviously, this didn't fix anything. It only served to enrage the other driver.</p>
      <p>Before I knew it, there was a break in traffic, and I made my turn. The other guy turned with me. I thought, "This is interesting." I made a couple of more turns, and the other guy was still behind me. I thought, "Oh, great! This guy is following me." I turned onto my girlfriend's street. The guy was still behind me. So, I pulled up to my girlfriend's house and then turned my head to see what the other guy was doing. He was turning around because he saw me pulling up to a house. I only saw the back of his head, but I could clearly see that the other guy was my girlfriend's dad! (It was unmistakeable, I recognized his car immediately.)</p>
      <p>He drove away (I think he thought I didn't see him). I rang the doorbell to my girlfriend's house, and, when she came to the door I, confessed, "I think I just gave your dad the finger." She wasn't very impressed with me, and the date didn't go very well.</p>
      <p>Just think how much better that date would have gone if I had taken my flying car. I would have flown right over that stupid intersection, and avoided all that tension and embarrassment. The moral of the story is: <strong>driving in traffic is slow, frustrating, and messy</strong>. Why drive in traffic when you can fly over it?</p>
      <p>Also, the other angry driver is now my father-in-law. I'm happy to report we're friends now.</p>

      <h2>There are a lot of brains and cash involved</h2>
      <p>I can't tell you which eVTOLs (<em>pronounced EE-VEE-tolz</em>) are going to become the next big commercial success. However,  I can tell you that some of us will probably be flying one of these new eVTOLs in the near future. At the <a href="https://youtu.be/ea1F92OPLFk?t=292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>2022 VFS Nikolsky Lecture</strong></a>, <strong>Professor Marilyn J. Smith</strong>, <em>Director of the Vertical Lift Research Center of Excellence (VLRCOE) at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta</em>, commented that there are more than 600 distinct <strong>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</strong> and <strong>Advanced Air Mobility</strong> aircraft designs listed on the <strong>Vertical Flight Society's eVTOL Aircraft Directory</strong>. Also, <strong>Professor Marilyn Smith</strong> pointed out that the <a href="https://aamrealityindex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Advanced Air Mobility Reality Index</strong></a> lists <strong>5</strong> to <strong>6 billion dollars</strong> in funding for these vehicles.</p>
      <p>That is an absolute explosion of innovation!</p>
      <p>If you don't believe that some of us will be flying one of these new eVTOLs in the near future, check out <a href="https://www.jetsonaero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jetson</strong></a>'s website. If you scroll down the page, you'll see that you can order your own personal electric aerial vehicle:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>To order your Jetson, a down payment of $22,000 is required. A final payment of $70,000 when your Jetson ONE is ready for delivery at the factory.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Jetson is fully booked with orders for their personal electric vehicles until the end of next year! The last time I checked, there were only three more chassis available for 2023 (chassis #168, #169, and #170).</p>

      <h2>Lilium</h2>
      <p>This is another very exciting eVTOL project that is making a name for itself. I'm starting to see pictures of the <strong>Lilium Jet</strong> everywhere given its attractive design. It's quickly becoming the poster child of this new eVTOL phenomenon.</p>
      <p><a href="https://lilium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lilium</strong></a> is hard at work making the <strong>Lilium Jet</strong>: a 7-Seater eVTOL with a maximum range of 300km (186 miles), assuming that better battery performance capabilities are achieved by the year 2025 and flight conditions are ideal.</p>
      <p>Check out this 11-minute video for a very interesting look at the engineering that is going into the making of the <strong>Lilium Jet</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Bellwether</h2>
      <p>Based out of London, England, <strong>Bellwether Industries</strong> is diligently working to create a sleek eVTOL aircraft that promises to "...build a brand new 3-Dimensional lifestyle and to lead the world toward a more comprehensive urban mobility."</p>
      <p><strong>Bellwether</strong>'s first project, <strong>Volar</strong>, has room for one person (who is also the pilot). The plan is to sell the Volar as a "Private Urban Aircraft for Intracity Travel." If you haven't seen pictures of the Volar yet, do yourself and your eyes a favour. Check out their website: <a href="https://www.bellwether-industries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bellwether Industries</strong></a>. It is a gorgeous aircraft!</p>

      <h2>Staying in the eVTOL Loop</h2>
      <p>It's difficult to keep track of everything that is going on in the eVTOL space. There is just so much happening every week. However, I rely heavily on these two websites to keep myself informed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://evtol.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>evtol.com</strong></a></li>
        <li><a href="https://evtol.news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Electric VTOL News<sup><small>TM</small></sup> by the Vertical Flight Society</strong></a>
          <ul>
            <li>Scroll down to see <strong>Upcoming Vertical Flight Society Events</strong></li>
            <li>Also, check out their <a href="https://evtol.news/aircraft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>eVTOL Aircraft Directory</strong></a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you have a favourite site to find your eVTOL news, please share in the comments.</p>
