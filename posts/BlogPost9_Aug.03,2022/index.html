    <article>
      <p>In case you haven't heard, I'm here to tell you that, with a little help from our good friends from <a href="https://smartskynetworks.com/aboutus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Smartsky</strong></a>, <strong>Neo-NextGen</strong>, and <a href="https://www.bourgetdesigns.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Alex</strong></a> our UI designer, we're building our own customized web app! I'm talking about our <strong>Quantum Web App</strong> project at AJWT.</p>

      <p>Here's a peak at the app we're building:</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>

      <p>That should be enough to get you out of your seat to do a little victory dance. Web technology is cool, sophisticated, and <strong>very powerful</strong>. Leveraging the power of the <strong>web</strong> in our business should be enough to make you want to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZB5zZ1ALk1Q?t=28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>celebrate</strong></a>!</p>

      <h2>Here's Why I am Excited about the Web</h2>
      <p>First, I should point out that a large part of the discussion about developing a web app has revolved around the Return on Investment (ROI).</p>
      <p>However, there are so many more benefits to developing a web app that I'd like to share with you. Here are a few things I get excited about when it comes to web applications.</p>

      <h3>1. Benefits of Web Applications:</h3>
      <p>In the article '<a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/what-is-web-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>What Is a Web Application? How It Works, Benefits and Examples</strong></a>' the <a href="https://www.indeed.com/leadershiphub/indeed-editorial-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Indeed Editorial Team</strong></a> spells out the benefits of web apps.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>A web application has many benefits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You don't need to install it on the hard drive, so it doesn't cause space limitations.</li>
          <li>It requires less support and maintenance from the business and lower technical requirements from the user's computer.</li>
          <li>A web application reduces costs for both the end-user and the business.</li>
          <li>Web applications are always up to date because updates are applied centrally.</li>
          <li>You can access web applications anywhere with a web browser.</li>
          <li>All users can access the same version, so it eliminates any compatibility issues.</li>
          <li>As long as the browser is compatible, web applications can run on multiple platforms regardless of the operating system or device.</li>
          <li>Web applications discharge the developer of the responsibility of building a client that is compatible with a specific type of computer or a particular operating system.</li>
          <li>Web applications reduce software piracy in subscription-based web applications.</li>
        </ul>

      </blockquote>

      <h3>2. Intuitive UI Design</h3>
      <p>So far, with the Quantum Web App, most of the meetings with the technicians at AJWT have focused on the design of the <strong>U</strong>ser <strong>I</strong>nterface. That's because it's advantageous to create an app that works the way you would expect it to. It's fundamental to the way we interact with the app. So, developing a good <strong>UI is the first, fundamental</strong> place to start when designing an app.</p>
      <p>Using an app with an intuitive interface saves you time and frustration. With a well-designed UI, there's no need to spend a lot of time learning or remembering how to use it. Well-designed UIs are relatively simple and largely self-explanatory. Interactions have clear, obvious labels that help a user immediately understand what to do.</p>
      <p>You can also design a workflow that prevents obvious '<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>footguns</strong></a>'</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For example, preventing a tech from changing the WO status to <strong>Costing</strong> <em>before</em> writing the <strong>Tear Down / Inspection Report</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>When it comes to our app, having a good UI will be most beneficial to the new technicians. Currently, new techs spend a good deal of time learning the ins and outs of Quantum. This means that there is potential to save a lot of time. Imagine having an app that a new technician could pick up and learn in 20 minutes. I'm sure the cell leads wouldn't complain if there were fewer mistakes to fix because the UI prevented new techs from making obvious errors.</p>

      <h3>3. The power of APIs</h3>
      <p><strong>What is an API?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>API</strong>s (<strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>I</strong>nterfaces) are a great way to add functionality to your web app. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>An API is a set of defined rules that explain how computers or applications communicate with one another.</p>
        <sub><cite><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Application Programming Interface (API) IBM Cloud</a></cite></sub>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For example, if you wanted to build a weather app,  you can take advantage of one of <a href="https://developer.accuweather.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>AccuWeather's APIs</strong></a>.</p>
      <p>AccuWeather's APIs have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The largest and best collection of real-time weather data</li>
        <li>Expert data analysis</li>
        <li>Forecasts with proven Superior Accuracy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Instead of going out on your own to set up weather sensors and designing your own data analytic tools, you can easily add functionality to your weather app by connecting to one of AccuWeather's APIs.</p>

      <p>Advantages of using APIs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Innovation</strong> =&#62; APIs enable businesses to respond quickly to expand their services by easily adding functionality</li>
        <li><strong>Integration</strong> =&#62; APIs enable seamless integration between apps</li>
        <li><strong>Data</strong> =&#62; APIs allow data to be shared easily across different platforms via website, Android, iOS, etc</li>
        <li><strong>Security</strong> =&#62; APIs create an extra layer of protection between your data and server</li>
      </ul>

      <p>So, it shouldn't be too surprising to find out that our <strong>Quantum Web App</strong> will connect to Quantum using the <a href="https://componentcontrol.com/solutions/products/modules/api-module" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>API Module for Quantum Control</strong></a>. This will enable us to connect our app to Quantum.</p>

      <h3>And So Much More!</h3>
      <p>Web technology is a large, ever-expanding subject. There is <strong>so much more</strong> to talk about!</p>
