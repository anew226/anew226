      <p>There's an emergency in the Blackbird hangar! Mystique disguised herself as D.B. Cooper and made off with a huge shipment of hardware that we needed to retrofit the rest of the X-Jet fleet with ruby quartz windshields so Scott can use his optic blast without his visor when he's flying. SB CYCLOPS-94-21 hardware requires slightly longer blots to secure the windshield. Otherwise the windshield may fail and Scott may be sucked out of the Jet at 20,000ft like that British pilot in the early 90s!!! :( We started work to embody the SB on two of the X-Jets, which means that we already removed their windshields and will not be ready for service until we recover the lost hardware or quickly make another PO to buy some new hardware. We need some better security down here!!! You need to fix this before the rest of the X-Jet fleet also becomes compromised!!!</p>

      <h2>Hold the Phone Mr. Deeds</h2>
      <p>Ben Deeds needs to, first, take a breath and then learn better email etiquette.</p>
      <p>Professor Xavier is a busy guy. He has multiple missions to plan, meetings with the secret council, his ongoing search and recruitment of new mutants, his ongoing research into Genetic and Biophysics, and, not to mention, Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters to run. Charles Xavier is a very busy man!</p>

      <h2>From email-0 to email-hero</h2>
      <p>Before you send a bad email that keeps you up at night and makes you wish you could just hit the '<strong>unsend</strong>' button, let's learn some basic email etiquette. (It's not so easy to '<strong>unsend</strong>' a bad email. Sometimes it's impossible.)</p>
      <p>(If you really must unsend an email, try <a href="https://www.getmailbird.com/the-best-way-to-unsend-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>How to Unsend an Email in Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo. Best Ways Explained</strong></a>.)</p>

      <h3><a href="https://syntax.fm/show/477/tips-for-communicating" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Syntax.fm episode 477: Tips for Communicating</a></h3>
      <p><strong>Syntax.fm</strong> is my favourite podcast to listen to on the long ride to work. <strong>Scott Tolinski</strong> and <strong>Wes Bos</strong> are two web developers who create a ton of great online content &mdash; everything from JavaScript, CSS, node modules, BBQ tips, git workflows, break-dancing, soft skills, and, of course, web development.</p>
      <p><strong>Wes</strong> is a web developer from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada &mdash; so, you should be huge fans of the show because Wes is Canadian &mdash; and <strong>Scott</strong> is a break-dancer and web developer from Denver, Colorado, USA. Together, they do an amazing job of teaching all things <strong>web</strong> to tens of thousands of <strong>dev</strong> fans. They're also a wonderful mood booster.</p>
      <p><strong>Here is a quick summary of this episode 477:</strong></p>

      <h4>Tip #1: Number Your Asks</h4>
      <p>When you're asking someone questions in an email, it's a good idea to number your questions.</p>
      <p>When Wes was emailing a store about buying a desk, he asked:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>How much is it?</li>
        <li>Is it still in stock?</li>
        <li>When can it be delivered?</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Tip #2: Bold the Important Parts</h4>
      <p>If there is a question or a piece of important information you want the reader to see, <strong>bolding the most important part makes it easy</strong> for the recipient to pick out the important details.</p>

      <h4>Tip #3: Use Paragraphs</h4>
      <p>Avoid writing big, long tomes with no paragraphs. It makes it impossible to catch all the important details.</p>
      <p>If you have a new idea, make a new paragraph.</p>

      <h4>Tip #4: Using '...'</h4>
      <p>Avoid using the '<strong>...</strong>' ellipsis. It's better to get your ideas together, type them up, then send. No one wants to read a long email chain of partial thoughts followed by '<strong>...</strong>'.</p>

      <h4>Tip #5: Error on the Side of Friendly</h4>
      <p>It's better if you can make your email sound like you're smiling and having a nice conversation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use only one '<strong>!</strong>' not '<strong>!!!</strong>'</li>
        <li>Avoid Smilies in your emails :-D</li>
        <li>Have a good tone: professional + a little bit friendly
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don't just use straight facts. It often comes off as terse - especially if the facts include bad news.</p>

      <h4>Tip #6: Recognize a Big Ask</h4>
      <p>Big asks are asking for something that the other person may or may not be able to do for you.</p>
      <p><strong>Example</strong>: When Wes emailed Lee from Vercel, he wrote, "Hey, I know this is a bit of a big ask. But do you think we could get back on our sponsored plan for the syntax website?" (Basically, can I have something for free?)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If it is a big request, give them an out: "If not, I understand. I am happy to pay for it as well."</li>
        <li>(Don't use a nervous out: "or whatever! lol")</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Tip #7: Mind the CC's</h4>
      <p>But first, before the tips, let's have a little CC and BCC primer:</p>
      <p>What does CC mean?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CC stands for <strong>Carbon Copy</strong></li>
        <li>Recipients who are CC'd will see everyone else's email</li>
        <li>'<strong>Reply all</strong>' will send to all people in '<strong>TO:</strong>' and '<strong>CC</strong>' fields</li>
        <li>Direct '<strong>Reply</strong>' only goes to person who drafted message</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is a good idea to use CC to keep other people in the loop, to introduce someone, to represent a team, or to show someone that <strong>you do not need a response</strong>.</p>
      <p>It's NOT a good idea to use CC to "copy up" (using CC to intentionally make someone look bad), to introduce someone without their consent, when you want a response from the recipient, when expecting an extended response from the main recipient, or when trying to inflate the size of your organization.</p>
      <!-- <p>When to use CC?:</p> -->
      <!-- <ul> -->
      <!-- <li>When you want to keep someone in the loop</li> -->
      <!-- <li>When introducing new people</li> -->
      <!-- <li>When representing a team</li> -->
      <!-- <li>When showing that you do not need a response</li> -->
      <!-- </ul> -->
      <!-- <p>When NOT to use CC?:</p> -->
      <!-- <ul> -->
      <!-- <li>"Copying up" - using CC to intentionally make someone look bad</li> -->
      <!-- <li>When introducing someone WITHOUT consent</li> -->
      <!-- <li>When you want a response from recipient</li> -->
      <!-- <li>When expecting an extended response from '<strong>TO:</strong>' recipient (CC'd people are going to get annoyed)</li> -->
      <!-- <li>When you're trying to inflate the size of your group (I come from a big company and here's all my colleagues)</li> -->
      <!-- </ul> -->

      <p>What does BCC mean?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>BCC stands for <strong>Blind Carbon Copy</strong></li>
        <li>Recipient receives email as if they were CC'd, but recipient will not see other people on email chain</li>
        <li>BCC recipients cannot see each other</li>
        <li>BCC is like stealth mode</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's a good idea to use BCC to send mass messages to a large group of people, to maintain the privacy of recipients, or to spare someone from lengthy email threads.</p>
      <p>It's NOT a good idea to use CC to "copy up" (to use BCC to intentionally make someone look bad), to introduce someone without their consent, to get a response from a recipient, to put people in the middle of a long email chain they have no interest in, or to exaggerate the size of your organization.</p>

      <!-- <p>When to use BCC?:</p> -->
      <!-- <ul> -->
      <!-- <li>When you're mass messaging</li> -->
      <!-- <li>When you want to maintain privacy of recipients</li> -->
      <!-- <li>When you want to spare someone from length email thread (e.g.: after email introduction)</li> -->
      <!-- </ul> -->
      <!-- <p>When NOT to use BCC?"</p> -->
      <!-- <ul> -->
      <!-- <li>"Copying up" - using BCC to make someone look bad</li> -->
      <!-- <li>When including an inappropriate eavesdropper</li> -->
      <!-- <li>To operate without transparency - just be up front and honest</li> -->
      <!-- </ul> -->

      <p><strong>Now, back to the tips:</strong></p>
      <p>Do not CC everyone on everything!</p>
      <p>Don't do a passive-aggressive CC. Don't email someone, "So, I just wanted to check in on that project you were supposed to have finished last week," and then CC that person's boss.</p>
      <p>Don't break the email chain: Use '<strong>Reply all</strong>' when replying to an email that has other people CC'd. Although the people who are on the CC list are not expected to reply, there's probably a good reason why they're being included in the loop.</p>
      <p><strong>Next Level</strong>: When someone CC's you in an email to introduce you to someone in another part of the company (or another company), thank the person, and then move them to BCC. Example: Scott introduces Wes to someone at <strong>Auth0</strong>. So, Wes sends a quick "thank you" email to Scott for the introduction, and then moves Scott to BCC (o Scott isn't included in the 'Reply all' emails between Wes and <strong>Auth0</strong>.</p>

      <p>Professor Xavier,</p>
      <p>We have a situation in the Blackbird hangar that requires attention:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mystique stole a large shipment of hardware</li>
        <li>We have <strong>two Blackbirds</strong> that are <strong>AOG</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Work to embody SB CYCLOPS-94-21 was started on two jets (the mod for Scott to use his optic blast without his visor while flying the jet). The windshields have already been removed from the two jets, and we no longer have the correct hardware to make the jets fit to fly &mdash; they are AOG. I know you're busy, but <strong>could you send Hank or Scott down here</strong>?</p>
      <p>We need help with:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Security</li>
        <li>Recovering stolen hardware</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Also, we've already made another PO for some new hardware  in case we're unable to recover the stolen hardware.</p>
      <p>Cheers,</p>
      <p>Benjamin Deeds</p>
