      <p>How far has voice recognition software progressed in the year 2022?</p>

  <section class="post">
    <article>
      <p>It has been suggested that, at some point, technicians will be able to use speech-to-text software to fill out paperwork. It's a very intriguing idea. So, I had to find out for myself.</p> 

      <p>The world of <a href="https://educationecosystem.com/guides/artificial-intelligence/natural-language/history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>NLP (Natural Language Processing)</strong></a> is an ever expanding, multidisciplinary field of study, and it's a working technology that's changing the way we interact with our computers. For me, it brings up images of Star Trek and the crew of the Enterprise-D seamlessly interacting with the ship's computer using their voice. The Enterprise crew made it look easy. However, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-linguistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>computational linguistics</strong></a> is tricky &mdash; it is a technology that we have been collectively working on since the 1950s.</p>

      <p>Data Scientists are still busy training AI models using Machine Learning on large sets of data. And, if that sounds like gibberish to you, or you're curious and want to learn more, <strong>check out the links at the bottom of this post. There is some great stuff there.</strong></p>

      <h3>Things That Interfere with Voice Recognition</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.totalvoicetech.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>totalvoicetech.com</strong></a>, there are '<a href="https://www.totalvoicetech.com/five-things-that-can-interfere-with-your-voice-recognition-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>5 Things That Can Interfere With Your Voice Recognition Software</strong></a>'.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Voices in the Background</li>
        <li>Speedy Talking and Dialects</li>
        <li>Music or Loud Noises in the Background</li>
        <li>Speaker's Distance from the Microphone</li>
        <li>Similar-sounding Words</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I would even add a one more thing to that list:</p>
      <ol start="6">
        <li>Industry-Specific Jargon / Vocabulary</li>
      </ol>

      <p>These are all things that will interfere with voice recognition software in our shop at AJWT. In Montr&eacute;al, we work in a noisy shop with a lot of background noise. There's the sound of hand tools clanking, power tools whirring, test rigs humming, other people talking, the sound of safety slides inflating, and sometimes music. Also, there's the factor of dialects. Montr&eacute;al is a beautifully multicultural city with many languages, cultures, and accents from all over the world.</p>

      <p>Level of background noise: (<strong>Note</strong>: these are not official numbers - decibel readings were taken using an app on my phone)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>My bench during lunchtime &#8594; 57 dB average</li>
        <li>My bench during working hours &#8594; 64 dB average</li>
        <li>Test rig while rig is on &#8594; 70 dB average</li>
        <li>My bench while safety slide is inflating &#8594; 84 dB average</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Although the background noise is greatest while inflating safety slides, this only happens for a moment and then it's over. Since the test rig is an area with prolonged, elevated background noise, I tested the voice recognition software while testing a unit. When I held the microphone closer to my mouth, I found the dictation was very accurate.</p>

      <h3>Okay, let's try it out!</h3>
      <p><strong>How far has voice recognition software progressed in the year 2022?</strong></p>

      <p>Since we plan to run our Quantum App on an iPad, I've been playing around with <strong>Siri</strong> and <strong>Dictation</strong> on my <strong>AJWT iPad Pro</strong> for the past 3-4 weeks. If you'd like to try this out for yourself, I recommend upgrading your <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-15/features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>iPadOS to version 15</strong></a> to get the latest version of <strong>Siri</strong> and apple's <strong>Dictation</strong> software.</p>

      <p>I know that not everyone's experience is going to be the same. However, <strong>my experience has been better speech-to-text accuracy when using Siri <em>after</em> training Siri on my voice</strong>.</p>

      <h4>Testing Out Speech-to-Text in Word</h4>
      <p>I downloaded the <strong>Word App</strong> for iPad from the <strong>App Store</strong>. However, you can try this out on almost any app on your iPad.</p>
      <p>In the Word App, you have two options for starting dictation. Tap either <strong>microphone</strong> to start dictation.</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/TapEitherMicrophone.png" alt="Tap either microphone to start dication">
      </figure>

      <p>You should see something that looks like this:</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/DictationInAction_1.PNG" alt="Dictation in action pic 1">
      </figure>

      <p>Or, like this:</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/DictationInAction_2.PNG" alt="Dictation in action pic 2">
      </figure>

      <h4>The Rain in Spain</h4>
      <p>I'm not sure why, but the idea of using voice recognition software brings up images of <strong>Professor Higgins</strong> and <strong>Eliza Doolittle</strong> from <a href="https://youtu.be/uVmU3iANbgk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>My Fair Lady</strong></a>.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So, I tried dictating this nonsense sentence to my iPad to see what would happen. I read the sentence out loud into my iPad, and, voil&agrave;, <strong>it was perfect</strong>. Professor Higgins would be so impressed.</p>

      <h4>The Reindeer in Spain</h4>
      <p>Okay, let's increase the difficulty level. It's time for the '<strong>Reindeer in Spain</strong>'.</p>
      <iframe width="434" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tH5oQ05Bs70" title="Whose Line - Colin's "Weird Newscasters" joke (reindeer)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Our top story today: Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer, dead at 53. I know, it is sad. Over Barcelona today, the famed reindeer was hit by a flock of seagulls and a 747. Eyewitnesses report that the reindeer in Spain was hit mainly by the plane."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Below is my first attempt at dictating this nonsense sentence, <strong><em>before</em></strong> training Siri. (This was done using <strong><em>only</em></strong> the built-in <strong>Dictation</strong> software <em>without</em> using the built-in <strong>Siri</strong> software.)</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Our top story today Rudolph the Red Nose reindeer dead at 53 I know it said over Barcelona today the same reindeer was hit by a flock of seagulls at 7:47 eyewitness report that the reindeer in Spain was it made me buy the plane</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So, yeah, this result brought up memories of seeing my speech language pathologist when I was young. Also, you may have noticed that there is <strong>no punctuation</strong>.</p>

      <h4>Adding Punctuation and Formatting Text</h4>
      <p>Let's look at Apple's Documentation: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/ipad/ipad997d9642/ipados" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Dictate text on iPad</strong></a>.</p>
      <!-- <p>Let's take a closer look at <strong>adding punctuation and formatting text</strong>.</p> -->
      <blockquote>
        <p>While dictating text, say the punctuation or formatting.</p>
        <p>For example, "Dear Mary comma the check is in the mail exclamation mark" becomes "Dear Mary, the check is in the mail!" Punctuation and formatting commands include the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>period</li>
          <li>comma</li>
          <li>exclamation point</li>
          <li>question mark</li>
          <li>dollar sign</li>
          <li>open parenthesis ... close parenthesis</li>
          <li>quote ... end quote</li>
          <li>new paragraph</li>
          <li>new line</li>
          <li>colon</li>
          <li>semicolon</li>
          <li>cap-to capitalize the next word</li>
          <li>caps on ... caps off-to capitalize the first character of each word</li>
          <li>all caps-to make the next word all uppercase</li>
          <li>all caps on ... all caps off-to make the enclosed words all uppercase</li>
          <li>no caps on ... no caps off-to make the enclosed words all lowercase</li>
          <li>no space-to eliminate the space between two words (not available for all languages)</li>
          <li>no space on ... no space off-to run a series of words together (not available for all languages)</li>
          <li>smiley-to insert :-)</li>
          <li>frowny-to insert :-(</li>
          <li>winky-to insert ;-)</li>
          <li>hash tag</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Training Siri on My Voice</h4>
      <p>To train Siri to recognize your voice better, go into settings on your iPad and then slide the '<strong>Listen for "Hey Siri"</strong>' toggle to the right.</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/SiriInSettings_iPadOS15.png" alt="Siri Settings in iPadOS15">
      </figure>

      <p>Next, you will be prompted to '<strong>Set Up "Hey Siri"</strong>'. Click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/SetUpHeySiri.PNG" alt="Set up 'Hey Siri'">
      </figure>

      <p>Now, this is your chance to train Siri on your voice. You will be prompted to read aloud <strong>five</strong> phrases into your <strong>iPad</strong>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/SayHeySiriIntoYouriPad.PNG" alt="Say 'Hey Siri' into your iPad">
      </figure>

      <p>When you're done, you'll get a message to tell you that '<strong>"Hey Siri" Is Ready</strong>'.</p>
      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/HeySiriIsReady.PNG" alt="'Hey Siri' is ready">
      </figure>

      <h4>The Reindeer in Spain Take Two</h4>
      <p>Now that I have trained Siri on my voice, let's try the '<strong>Reindeer in Spain</strong>' again. This time, I'll try to add some punctuation.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Our top story today: Rudolph the Red Nose reindeer, dead at 53. I know, it is sad. Over Barcelona today, the famed reindeer was hit by a Flock of Seagulls and a 747. Eyewitnesses report that the reindeer in Spain was hit mainly by the plane.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Take that Professor Higgins!</strong></p>

      <h4>Dictating Technical Jargon</h4>
      <p>So, I'm don't think that my Aircraft Maintenance paperwork will have many reindeer or seagulls. However, technicians do have their own set of technical jargon to consider.</p>
      <p>Aircraft maintenance technicians use words and phrases like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>LVDT</li>
        <li>Servovalve</li>
        <li>Piston seal dynamic leakage</li>
        <li>Under grounding strap</li>
        <li>Amendment plate (PN: 9040-300)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here's my first attempt at dictating my paperwork:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>Cover assembly (PN: 340859) is corroded (please refer to pictures).</li>
          <li>Pin equipped (PN: 346830) found contaminated with service fluid.</li>
          <li>Surface corrosion found on block, valve, assembly (PN: 340902- 100) Undergrounding strap.</li>
          <li>Name plate (PN: 346127) is missing (please refer to pictures).</li>
          <li>Amendment plate (PN: 9040- 300) is missing (please refer to pictures).</li>
          <li>Indicating plate (PN: 418577) is missing (please refer to pictures).</li>
          <li>Electrical cover (PN: 66354- 012) is missing (please refer to pictures).</li>
          <li>Servovalve (PN: a 88004- 005 S N: Be 6125) is defective.</li>
          <li>I end (PN: 340861- 100 S N: 007) bearing is worn (high end is not repairable).</li>
          <li>Spring (PN: 340926) is warn.</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It's not terrible. However, it's not great either. If you look closely, you'll notice a few errors.</p>

      <h4>Letting App Learn from Interactions</h4>
      <p>To help improve the accuracy of dictation, let's ensure that <strong>Siri is learning from the App</strong> that we're using.</p>

      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/LearnFromThisAppWord_1.png" alt="ensure Siri is learning from App pic 1">
      </figure>

      <figure>
        <img loading="lazy" src="pics/LearnFromThisAppWord_2.png" alt="ensure Siri is learning from App pic 2">
      </figure>

      <h4>Siri Learning from My Corrections</h4>
      <p>Now that I know Siri is learning from the App, I'll try some more dictation. This time I'll go back and manually correct the errors, then I'll repeat the phrase.</p>
      <p>For the sake of brevity, I'll concentrate on only one phrase.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>First dictation attempt:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spring (PN: 340926) is <strong>warn</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Manually correction</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spring (PN: 340926) is <strong>worn</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Second dictation attempt:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spring (PN: 340926) is <strong>warn</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Manually correction</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spring (PN: 340926) is <strong>worn</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Third dictation attempt:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Spring (PN: 340926) is <strong>worn</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Success! No more manual corrections required.</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>After only a few manual corrections, the accuracy of the dictation improved.</p>

      <h4>SiriKit</h4>
      <p>There's another tool that can be used to increase the accuracy of dictation, it involves <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit/registering_custom_vocabulary_with_sirikit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>registering custom vocabulary with SiriKit</strong></a>.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Apps adopt SiriKit by building an extension that communicates with Siri, even when your app isn't running. The extension registers with specific domains and intents that it can handle. Siri handles all of the interaction, including the voice and natural language recognition, and works with your extension to get information and handle requests.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This something that is worth looking into further for our own Quantum Web App.</p>

      <h4>Voice Coding</h4>
