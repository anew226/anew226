      <h1>Why Transform Digitally? (Opinion)</h1>
      <p>Some of my thoughts on digital transformation</p>
      <date>Jun.15, 2022</date>

      <p>I'm sure some of us are wondering: Why bother transforming digitally? Why bother investing in fixing something that's not broken? Do we really need to waste our time and money on fixing something that works fine? Or maybe you are the opposite: Which digital tools should I invest in? There're just too many solutions, which solution is the best solution?</p>
      <p>Personally, I think those are all valid questions. I mean, why bother putting effort into changing something that's working just fine. Maybe those software developers are trying to sell me something I don't need.</p>
      <hr>

      <h2>Don't Fix it If it Ain't Broke</h2>
      <p>First of all, I don't think it's ever a good idea to change something that's working fine &mdash; really. Unfortunately, we infrequently find ourselves wasting time and money on new fads, despite all our best intentions. Usually, we only realize our misstep after the fact &mdash; it's called "buyer's remorse". For myself, this tends to happen with musical instruments. Some time ago I bought a new electric guitar, even though I already had three at home just like it. I bought it because guitars are awesome, and having more guitars is more awesome. However, I really didn't need a fourth electric guitar. I probably could have put that money to better use.</p>
      <p>Maybe I should have invested in some guitar lessons instead.</p>

      <h2>Why Risk Innovating?</h2>
      <p>Why risk introducing something new when having a routine has huge benefits. Routines are well traversed paths that we know like the back of our hands (looking at the back of my own hand &mdash; Oh! That's new). Like I said, routines are hugely beneficial to us. If you want to do something in life, you need a routine. Some of us have some beneficial routines. I hope most of us brush our teeth. Some of us have detrimental routines. Hopefully no one is running around downtown picking fights with the cops. Then, there's some of us who have hugely beneficial routines, like pro athletes and enormously successful entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>To me, creating beneficial routines is the process of taking stock of my reality - as it is now, and then using my imagination to dream about what I'd like my reality to become. I find this works best when I get very optimistic about what I want, but also very honest about what's working for me and what's not working for me. Then I find a way to take action to alter my routine.</p>
      <p>Of course, this is easier said than done. There's a whole industry devoted to helping people and businesses change and innovate. Why? Because we are creatures of habit. We all desire a sense of continuity and stability &mdash; especially when we see the world around us going mad.</p>

      <h2>Innovating and Deciding, for Companies and People</h2>
      <p>Life is full of complicated situations. So, how do you cut through all the noise and decide the best course of action?</p>
      <p>You need good information to make good decisions. So, you gather as much good information as you possible can until you're satisfied. Carefully you start putting the pieces together, but you soon realize it's not entirely clear. Maybe you have conflicting information. Maybe you have too much information (like Mark Ruffalo's character in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9071322/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Dark Waters</strong></a> &mdash; a very excellent movie). Maybe you don't have enough information to comfortably make an easy decision. So, what do you do?</p>
      <p>I think most of us find ourselves in the situation of having to make decisions despite great uncertainty (when we don't have all the information to comfortably make an easy decision). I'm sure most of us are pretty bad at telling the future. I know I am. I should have bought Bitcoin at $100/coin (when my wife was telling me to...yup).</p>
      <p><a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/thinking-in-bets-innovation-uncertainty-decision-making-CLIS9z2m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Innovating and Deciding, for Companies and People</strong></a> is a very excellent podcast episode on <a href="https://a16z.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>A16Z</strong></a> where "Marc Andreesen and Sonal interview author, consultant/advisor, and former pro poker player Annie Duke".</p>
      <p>I've listened to it a few times because it's just that good. Have a listen, it's a great episode.</p>

      <h2>The 80/20 Rule</h2>
      <p>The 80/20 rule is an idea that I have been hearing everywhere.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"The Pareto Principle, named after economist Vilfredo Pareto, specifies that 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes, asserting an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs. This principle serves as a general reminder that the relationship between inputs and outputs is not balanced. The Pareto Principle is also known as the Pareto Rule or the 80/20 Rule."</p>
        <sub><cite><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pareto Principle at Investopedia</a></cite></sub>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The way I understand the 80/20 rule is that you can realize 80% of the benefits if you focus your effort on the highest value 20%.</p>
      <p>I tend to think about applying this to cleaning a very messy garage.</p>
      <p>Imagine you have a garage that you've been using to store all sorts of things: an old car you haven't moved for years, wrenches, sockets, hammers, left over 2x4s from when you repaired your back porch, all those old toys that were collecting dust in the house, some old newspapers and magazines, etc....</p>
      <p>So, where do you start? What is 20% of the junk that you can remove that would leave the garage 80% cleaner?</p>
      <p>Well, if you were applying the 80/20 rule, you would start with the obvious junk (the stuff that's really in the way). You would start with the large, bulky things that, when removed from the garage, would make cleaning the rest of the garage that much easier.</p>
      <p>At the risk of getting too philosophical:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."</p>
        <p><sub><cite>Marcus Aurelius &mdash; emperor of Rome</cite></sub></p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>A Good Approach</h2>
      <p>So, if you've read this far, you'll probably have noticed that I haven't answered any of the questions I posed. Pretty good, eh?</p>
      <p>Here we go (in my opinion):</p>
      <p><strong>Question</strong>: Why fix something that's working fine</p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong>: Don't fix it. Keep the routines that are working.</p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>Question</strong>: Why risk innovating?</p>
      <p><strong>Answer</strong>: Despite all the risks involved, the advantages gained by finding a new way of doing something faster, better, cheaper, safer gives one enormous competitive advantages.</p>
      <p>(Those are the easy ones!)</p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>The Tough Question</strong>: Why transform digitally?</p>
      <p>I think the answer to this question involves some reflecting and planning using good information.</p>
      <p>When it comes to digital transformation, it pays to learn about the potential of available software. For example: did you know that you can use AI and Machine Learning to quickly and accurately complete repetitive tasks. Some businesses are using these tools to <strong><em>drastically</em></strong> reduce the amount of time it takes to input information (information that would otherwise be input manually).</p>
      <p>When it comes to any transformation, it pays to do some self-reflection to see what you're doing well (and to hold onto that). More importantly, to transform, you need to identify the biggest areas of improvement &mdash; the 20% that will give you 80% of the results. Then, change the routine. To do this, you really need to know your own business' routines.</p>
      <p>If you understand your business' strengths and areas for improvement, and, also, understand what these digital tools can do, you will be well positioned to introduce something new and innovative that will really improve and strengthen your business. Done well, a digital transformation will supercharge what you're <em>already</em> good at.</p>
