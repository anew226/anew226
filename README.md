<p align="center">Hi, I'm Andrew</p>

<h3 align="center"> I'm an Aerospace Component Technician and Web Development Student</h3>

I have been in aerospace maintenance over 10 years. However, during the last 2 years, due to an unexpected situation, suddenly I had a lot more free time at home. To take advantage, I started learning coding and web Development. Now I'm hooked. My goal is to blend my experience in aerospace maintenace with my new coding skills.
